# MigsList Business Plan

## Executive Summary

MigsList is a cloud-based software solution designed specifically for Canadian union locals to manage their Members In Good Standing (MIGS). After 20 years working in the union family and transitioning to a data analyst role, I identified a critical gap: most union locals still rely on outdated spreadsheets, paper filing systems, and manual processes to track member compliance—leading to wasted hours, costly errors, and election integrity risks.

MigsList solves this by providing a modern, secure, easy-to-use platform that allows union executives to:
- Track member standing status in real-time
- Generate voter lists for elections with one click
- Store and manage PDF documents per member
- Export reports to Excel and PDF
- Send email communications to members

The service has been tested and refined over the past year with several union locals, ensuring it meets the real-world needs of union administration.

**Business Model:** Annual SaaS subscription
**Pricing:** $500 CAD (first year) / $800 CAD (renewals)
**Target Market:** Union locals in Ontario, Canada
**Competitive Advantage:** Built specifically for unions, Canadian data sovereignty, simple pricing, personal support from a union family member

## Problem Statement

Union locals face significant challenges with member management:

1. **Outdated Systems:** Most locals use spreadsheets, paper files, or legacy software that's difficult to maintain and share.

2. **Election Integrity Risks:** Inaccurate member records lead to ballots sent to ineligible members, disputed elections, and potential legal challenges.

3. **Administrative Burden:** Recording Secretaries spend countless hours on manual data entry, searching through files, and generating reports.

4. **Compliance Tracking:** Knowing which members have submitted required paperwork (dues checkoff, good standing documents) is a constant challenge.

5. **Cost of Errors:** Mistakes during rank-and-file list generation cause friction between administrators and leadership, wasting time and money.

6. **Data Security Concerns:** Sensitive member information stored in spreadsheets or local computers is vulnerable to loss, theft, or corruption.
