  | Site         | https://migslist.com      |
  | Server IP    | 155.138.149.116           |
  | SSH          | ssh wayne@155.138.149.116 |

  | Restart app  | pm2 restart migs          |

  To deploy updates later:
  ssh wayne@155.138.149.116
  cd /var/www/migs
  git pull
  pm2 restart migs

  What's in place:
  - PM2 startup service (pm2-wayne) is enabled via systemd
  - Process list is saved in /home/wayne/.pm2/dump.pm2
  - On server reboot, systemd will automatically start PM2, which will resurrect the migs app

  Why it likely stopped:
  - The server probably rebooted and had two conflicting PM2 startup configs (one for root, one for wayne)
  - I removed the root one, so now only wayne's PM2 will start

  To verify it's set up correctly:
  ssh wayne@155.138.149.116 "systemctl is-enabled pm2-wayne"

  If you ever need to manually restart:
  ssh wayne@155.138.149.116 "pm2 restart migs"

  You're all set - next time the server reboots, the app will start automatically.
