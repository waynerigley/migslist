How many filing cabinets does your local have?

Paper systems worked for decades, but they create real problems:
- Documents get lost or misfiled
- No backup if there's a fire or flood
- Only accessible at the union hall
- Hours searching for one form

MigsList stores all your member documents securely in the cloud. Access them anywhere, anytime.

The labour movement runs on the dedication of members like you.

In Solidarity.
