## Hashtag Best Practices (2025 Research)

**CRITICAL: Use only 1-3 hashtags per post.** Facebook's algorithm penalizes posts with too many hashtags.

### Recommended Hashtags (Pick 2-3 max per post)

**Always include branded hashtag:**
- #MigsList (build brand recognition)

**Primary - High relevance (pick 1-2):**
- #UnionStrong (most recognized union hashtag)
- #OntarioUnions (geographic targeting)
- #LabourMovement (broad union reach)

**Topic-specific (pick 1 when relevant):**
| Topic | Hashtag |
|-------|---------|
| Elections | #UnionElections |
| Admin/Secretary content | #UnionAdmin |
| Canadian data/privacy | #MadeInCanada |
| Solidarity posts | #InSolidarity |
| Recording Secretary focus | #RecordingSecretary |

**Formatting:**
- Place hashtags at END of post (keeps content clean)
- Capitalize each word: #UnionStrong not #unionstrong
- Never use spaces in hashtags

**DON'T use:**
- Generic hashtags (#love, #business, #software)
- More than 3 hashtags
- Hashtags in the middle of sentences

## Content Strategy (What Performs Best in 2025)

### Top Performing Content Types

1. **Short Video (60-90 seconds)** - Highest ROI
   - 83% of marketers say <60 sec videos perform best
   - First 3 seconds MUST hook the viewer
   - Educational > Promotional
   - Show real people, not polished graphics

2. **Text Posts with Colorful Backgrounds**
   - Facebook's colored background feature gets algorithm boost
   - Keep text concise and punchy
   - Great for solidarity messages

3. **Problem/Solution Posts**
   - Lead with the pain point (hook)
   - Show the path to solution
   - End with clear CTA

4. **Bulleted Lists**
   - Easy to scan
   - Higher engagement than paragraphs
   - Use checkmarks or bullet points

### Content Funnel Strategy

| Stage | Goal | Content Type |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Cold (Awareness) | Build trust | Pain point posts, union solidarity, tips |
| Warm (Consideration) | Show solution | Feature highlights, how-it-works |
| Hot (Decision) | Convert | Free trial offer, pricing, testimonials |

**Mix:** 60% Cold, 30% Warm, 10% Hot

To every shop steward, recording secretary, and union volunteer—thank you.

• Hours searching for one form
